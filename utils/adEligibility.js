/**
 * The single place that decides whether a given playback carries an ad.
 *
 * There are three independent reasons not to serve one, and they belong together so
 * no caller can honour one and forget the others:
 *
 *   • The video's OWNER is not on the serving allowlist. While ADS_ALLOWED_OWNERS is
 *     non-empty this is the first and hardest gate: ads run on those accounts' videos
 *     and nowhere else, whatever a campaign booked. It lives here rather than in the
 *     session route so that every future caller — stitcher, forecast, a report — gets
 *     the same answer without having to remember the rule.
 *
 *   • The VIEWER pays for Pro. Someone paying to support the platform being shown
 *     ads is the clearest possible way to make Pro feel worthless, so premium
 *     always wins over any inventory pressure.
 *   • The CREATOR turned ads off. Their videos carry none, and the forecast drops
 *     them too, so nothing is sold that we have promised not to use.
 *   • The creator turned ads off on THIS video only (utils/videoAdOptOut.js).
 *
 * The premium set is read from the same `embed-users.premium` flag that
 * services/premiumSubsSync.js keeps in step with Okinoko subs every 60s, and that
 * utils/premiumBoost.js already uses for the creator ranking boost. Unlike that
 * one, this gates on `premium_expires_at` locally as well: the sync can be up to a
 * minute behind, and a one-day pass that lapsed thirty seconds ago should not
 * start showing ads mid-session.
 *
 * Cached in-process with stale-while-revalidate, same shape as premiumBoost — the
 * premium set is global and tiny, so this is one cheap Mongo query per TTL window
 * and never blocks a playback decision. A cold miss is deliberately FAIL-SAFE: it
 * answers "no ads" rather than risking an ad in front of a paying subscriber.
