/**
 * Pays creators (and the communities they post in) for ads their videos carried.
 *
 * WHY A PERIOD POOL, AND NOT PER CAMPAIGN
 * The obvious design — take a campaign's fee, divide by the impressions that
 * campaign delivered, pay those creators — is wrong, and wrong in a way creators
 * would notice immediately. Per-impression value would then depend on the campaign
 * that happened to be shown, not on the audience the creator brought:
 *
 *     50 HBD over 7 days delivering   100 plays → 0.2500 HBD per play
 *     50 HBD over 90 days delivering 2000 plays → 0.0125 HBD per play
 *
 * Two creators with identical delivery would be paid twenty times differently
 * because the rotation gave one of them the short expensive flight. So instead:
 * every campaign accrues revenue PRO RATA over its own flight, all accruals inside
 * a period are pooled, and that pool is divided by every impression in the period.
 * One rate for everyone, per period.
 *
 * It also fixes the other half of the problem — WHEN. Settling at flight end meant
 * a creator could wait up to 90 days for a share of a campaign that finished on
 * someone else's schedule. Periods close on a fixed cadence and pay everyone
 * together, whether or not any particular flight has ended.
 *
 * A period with no impressions does not lose the money: its pool carries into the
 * next period, because the advertiser paid for the time either way and the pool
 * belongs to the creator side regardless of when it gets distributed.
 *
 * DRY RUN unless AD_PAYOUT_ACTIVE_KEY is set — and note a Hive `transfer` needs the
 * ACTIVE authority, not the posting key everything else here uses. Without it the
 * plan is computed, stored and logged, and nothing moves. That is the correct
 * default for code that sends money.

 * 🚨 THE CHAIN IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH, NOT OUR DATABASE.
 * This decides where money goes, and `embed-video.category` is a denormalised copy of
 * something Hive already knows authoritatively. It was the only source until
 * 2026-08-31, and it silently underpaid communities: the field is missing on a small
 * share of videos that ARE in a community on chain (99 of 5,453 eligible on
 * 2026-08-30, across BOTH the 3speak-tv and ecency upload paths, so a sporadic write
 * failure rather than one broken client). A missing category read as "not in a
 * community", the creator was paid 100%, and nothing said otherwise.
 *
 * Mongo is now used only to find WHICH post to ask about, never for the answer. A
 * sample of 60 videos that did have a stored value found 60 agreeing with the chain,
 * so this is not fixing a present-day mismatch — it removes the dependency on a copy
 * that has already been wrong once by omission and could drift again silently.
 *
 * ⚠️ FALLBACK WHEN HIVE IS UNREACHABLE. Requiring the chain unconditionally would let
 * an RPC outage halt every payout, including the ~98% whose stored value was measured
 * accurate. So on a failed batch a stored community is used, loudly, and only a video
 * with NO stored value is left unresolved. That keeps an outage from stopping
 * everyone while still refusing to guess where there is nothing to guess from.
 *
 * 🚨 AND WHY THE THREE-WAY RESULT MATTERS
 * `null` (definitely no community — an upload with no Hive post) and "we could not
 * find out" are completely different, and collapsing them is the original bug: an
 * unknown treated as a null pays the community's share to the creator, in a
 * settlement that is idempotent and therefore never revisited. `hiveRpcBatch` returns
 * [] when every endpoint fails, which is indistinguishable from "no posts found", so
 * that case is caught here rather than read as data.
 *
 * Resolved in one pass rather than per impression: a period holds thousands of
 * impressions over far fewer videos, and the lookups batch.

 * conditional update BEFORE the broadcast, so a crash mid-flight leaves it parked
 * rather than re-sent by the next run. Double-paying a refund is unrecoverable;
 * a stuck row is a support ticket. The payout path above does mark-after-send and
