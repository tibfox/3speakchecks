/**
 * Booking and payment. Forked from routes/promote.js, which already solved the
 * hard part: prove an on-chain transfer happened, exactly once, without trusting
 * anything the client says about it.
 *
 * AUTH MODEL, and why there is no signature here:
 *   Creating a campaign is authorised by the advertiser's `reference` — the
 *   unguessable token their approved application returned. That is enough because
 *   an unpaid campaign does nothing at all: it cannot serve, cannot spend, and is
 *   invisible to viewers. The thing that actually costs money is the on-chain
 *   transfer, and that is verified against Hive itself, not against a claim in a
 *   request body. So the security sits where the value is, and advertisers whose
 *   login cannot sign a message (HiveSigner, Butter Auth) are not shut out of
 *   spending money with us.
 *
 *   Routes:
 *     GET  /advertise/pricing                     rate card + where to pay
 *     POST /advertise/campaigns                   create a flight (approved advertisers)
 *     GET  /advertise/campaigns?reference=…       the advertiser's own campaigns
 *     POST /advertise/campaigns/:id/creative      attach an uploaded spot
 *     POST /advertise/campaigns/:id/claim         verify payment, schedule the flight
