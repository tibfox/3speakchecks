/**
 * Server-side ad insertion, and the delivery measurement that comes with it.
 *
 * Mounted at `/m` — NOT under /advertise. Every URL a viewer's browser fetches
 * has to be indistinguishable from ordinary playback, and a path containing
 * "advertise" is the single easiest thing in the world for a filter list to match.
 * Nothing this router serves carries the words ad, vast, or preroll.
 *
 *   POST /m/session            decide + open a session, return a manifest URL
 *   GET  /m/:sid.m3u8          the stitched playlist (master or media)
 *   GET  /m/:sid/:n            the two measured segments (302 → CDN)
 *
 * WHY THIS DEFEATS BLOCKERS: there is no second request to recognise. The spot is
 * already inside the playlist the player asked for, its segments come from the
 * same BunnyCDN host and path shape as the video's own, and `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY`
 * is a standard tag hls.js handles natively. What it does NOT defeat is a viewer
 * seeking past the break — deliberately, because disabling the scrubber makes the
 * player feel broken and we would rather charge for what was actually watched.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A VIDEO PROXY: exactly two segments per play come through here,
 * and both are 302s to the CDN. Everything else is absolutised to BunnyCDN so the
 * bytes never transit this box — the same constraint 3speak-gate is built around,
 * and for the same reason: a 1080p viewer is ~3 Mbit/s and this machine averages
 * about 2.4 Mbit/s across every service it runs.
 *
 * MEASUREMENT: an impression is a segment fetch we observed, never a client pixel —
 * a pixel is precisely the thing an adblocker kills. Caveat worth stating: HLS
 * players fetch ahead, so the closing beacon can be requested slightly before it is
 * played. Every server-side ad system has this property; it is a small over-count,
 * not a fabrication, and it is why payout counts completions rather than starts.

/* ─── POST /m/:sid/w — seconds of the spot that actually played ───────── */
/**
 * What the viewer really saw, reported by the player.
 *
 * 🚨 THIS IS NOW THE PRIMARY DELIVERY SIGNAL. Segment fetches measure what a player
 * DOWNLOADED, and a player downloads ahead of what it shows: a five-segment 29s spot
 * asks for its closing segment around eleven seconds in, and does not put that segment
 * on screen until 24.6s. Billing off fetches therefore over-counted the buffered and
 * under-counted the watched at the same time, and with a threshold of half the
 * booking it managed to count nothing at all — spots stayed `started` forever and
 * their campaigns never left `scheduled`.
 *
 * So the player says how many seconds of ad it actually played, and AD_COUNT_AFTER_SECONDS
 * decides when that is worth billing. Three seconds on screen is a delivered
 * impression: the advertiser was seen, the creator carried it, both get paid.
 *
 * `watchedSeconds` is kept whatever the verdict, as a high-water mark, so how much of
 * a spot people really sit through stays an answerable question separately from who
 * got paid. A spot billed at three seconds and watched to 29 are both true of the same
 * row.
 *
 * NOT TAKEN ON TRUST, but the check is arithmetic rather than a puzzle: you cannot
 * have watched N seconds in fewer than N seconds of wall clock. A script that opens a
 * session and immediately claims the whole spot is credited with the time that has
 * really passed, which is none. That is the same property the pacing rule had, at a
 * threshold a genuine three-second view can actually reach.
 *
 * 🚨 The pre-upload gate is exempt. It completes on POST /:sid/posted, with a real
 * video to point at, because there the person watching is the person being paid and
 * "watch it and get credited" is a loop somebody can sit in. Watching it still records
 * the seconds; it just never bills.
