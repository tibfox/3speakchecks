/**
 * Server-side ad insertion, and the delivery measurement that comes with it.
 *
 * Mounted at `/m` — NOT under /advertise. Every URL a viewer's browser fetches
 * has to be indistinguishable from ordinary playback, and a path containing
 * "advertise" is the single easiest thing in the world for a filter list to match.
 * Nothing this router serves carries the words ad, vast, or preroll.
 *
 *   POST /m/session            decide + open a session, return a manifest URL
 *   GET  /m/:sid.m3u8          the stitched playlist (master or media)
 *   GET  /m/:sid/:n            the two measured segments (302 → CDN)
 *
 * WHY THIS DEFEATS BLOCKERS: there is no second request to recognise. The spot is
 * already inside the playlist the player asked for, its segments come from the
 * same BunnyCDN host and path shape as the video's own, and `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY`
 * is a standard tag hls.js handles natively. What it does NOT defeat is a viewer
 * seeking past the break — deliberately, because disabling the scrubber makes the
 * player feel broken and we would rather charge for what was actually watched.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A VIDEO PROXY: exactly two segments per play come through here,
 * and both are 302s to the CDN. Everything else is absolutised to BunnyCDN so the
 * bytes never transit this box — the same constraint 3speak-gate is built around,
 * and for the same reason: a 1080p viewer is ~3 Mbit/s and this machine averages
 * about 2.4 Mbit/s across every service it runs.
 *
 * MEASUREMENT: an impression is a segment fetch we observed, never a client pixel —
 * a pixel is precisely the thing an adblocker kills. Caveat worth stating: HLS
 * players fetch ahead, so the closing beacon can be requested slightly before it is
 * played. Every server-side ad system has this property; it is a small over-count,
 * not a fabrication, and it is why payout counts completions rather than starts.
