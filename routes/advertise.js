/**
 * Advertiser intake + the approval gate.
 *
 * "We don't let everyone in" is the product requirement, so nothing here creates
 * a bookable advertiser on its own: an application lands as `pending` and a human
 * has to move it. Approval is the only thing that unlocks a campaign later, which
 * keeps the gate in one place instead of scattered across the booking flow.
 *
 * Public surface
 *   GET  /advertise/inventory              audience + deliverable slots (sanitised)
 *   POST /advertise/apply                  submit an application → opaque reference
 *   GET  /advertise/application/:reference status by reference (no account enumeration)
 *   GET  /advertise/creator/prefs/:account whether an account carries ads
 *   POST /advertise/creator/prefs          creator opt-out, Hive-signature required
 *   POST /advertise/creator/video-ads/sync per-video opt-out, mirrored from the post on chain
 *
 * Admin surface (Bearer AD_ADMIN_SECRET — deliberately NOT the frontend's key)
 *   GET  /advertise/admin/applications     the queue
 *   POST /advertise/admin/applications/:id/decide
 *   GET  /advertise/admin/inventory        full snapshot, including who was excluded
 *   POST /advertise/admin/inventory/refresh
 *   GET  /advertise/admin/rates            platform rate card, and where each price came from
 *   POST /advertise/admin/rates            set or clear one format's default price
 *   GET  /advertise/admin/advertisers/rates          who is below today's platform rate
 *   GET  /advertise/admin/advertisers/:id/rates      one advertiser's rates vs the platform's
 *   POST /advertise/admin/advertisers/:id/rates      move one advertiser onto a new rate
 *   GET  /advertise/admin/refunds                    payments refused as sent from the wrong account
 *   POST /advertise/admin/refunds/:trxId/settle      record that one was sent back
 *
 * PRIVACY: no IP is stored. The per-IP throttle below lives in memory for ten
 * minutes and never reaches Mongo — same posture as routes/reports.js and the
 * watch tracker, and the thing the GDPR work on this codebase has been moving
 * everything toward.

 * so that no endpoint takes an account name and confirms whether it applied — this
 * route would undo that if it answered on a name alone, because what sits behind a
 * reference is contact details, a stated budget, the applicant's brief, our private
 * note to them and a payment memo. So it costs a signature, and the signature goes
 * in a body rather than a query string where access logs would keep it.
 *
 * Accepted proof is the same pair the opt-out control accepts: the account's own
 * posting key, or a posting-authority delegate we sign with (@threespeak). The
 * delegate path is what makes this work at all for HiveSigner and Butter Auth
 * sessions, which hold no key in the browser.
 *
 * Or `vouched: true`: 3Speak's API signed mineVouchMessage with its own key after
 * verifying a real login session (Butter Auth, HiveSigner, or a wallet login). That
 * needs no posting grant, which is what lets a returning advertiser see their own
 * products on arrival with no wallet prompt. It is a read of what the account already
 * owns, the same trust the API's session already carries. (Owner's call, 2026-10-03.)
 *

/**
 * Move one advertiser onto different rates.
 *
 * Three request shapes, because the real jobs are different sizes:
 *
 *   { format, ratePerSecondDayHbd }   one format. null/'' REMOVES their own rate for
 *                                     it, dropping them onto whatever the platform
 *                                     charges today AND keeping them tracking it —
 *                                     which storing a copy of today's number would not.
 *
 *   { rates: { <format>: n|null } }   several at once. This is the shape the year-later
 *                                     review actually needs: an advertiser holds a rate
 *                                     for every format, so "put them on new prices" is
 *                                     four changes, and doing it in four calls leaves
 *                                     them on a mixture of old and new if one fails.
 *
 *   { snapshotPlatform: true }        re-freeze them at today's platform rates, all
 *                                     formats. The founding discount ends, they move to
 *                                     current prices, and they hold THOSE until somebody
 *                                     moves them again — the same deal they had before,
 *                                     at the new number. This is the one-click version
 *                                     of the whole "after a year" job.
 *
 * Whichever shape is used, the write is a single updateOne, so an advertiser is never
 * left half-repriced.

/* ─── returns owed on refused payments ────────────────────────────────────
 * A transfer sent from an account other than the one a campaign is booked under is
 * refused rather than credited (routes/adCampaigns.js claim) — paying from the
 * account IS how an advertiser proves they hold it, so a payment from elsewhere
 * proves nothing and cannot be allowed to buy a flight in that name.
 *
 * The money still arrived, so it goes back — automatically, on the payout run
 * (services/adPayouts.js refundRefusedPayments). A payment we have declined to
 * accept is simply not ours, and holding it pending a human is holding somebody's
 * money for no reason. Contrast the under-delivery shortfall, which is a judgement
 * about delivery and is KEPT as spendable credit (utils/adBalance.js).
 *
 * These routes are the window onto that, plus the manual override: anything parked
 * at `review` (unparseable amount, or too many failed sends) needs a person to check
 * the chain and settle it by hand.
